The system runs on a platform that has the following capabilities:
- It has a backend that allows the system to run code. With Deno 2. It can attend to actions, return values and emit events.
- It has a storage system that allows the system to store data which is part of the backend. It uses SQLite.
- It has a UI that allows the user to interact with the system. It uses React 18.

The tools the system creates are local to the user's machine and have desktop capabilities (native) though Deno and the PowBlocs platform (desktop app they run on). These tools are minimal and don't need authentication.

The specification should be high-level and should not include any code. It should be a list of features and capabilities that the system should have, with enough detail but geared towards a non-technical audience. Use markdown formatting.

Keep the tool's capabilities minimal and simple. Don't include any complex features, just the basics. The tool should be single purposed and should be easy to understand and use. Single functionality, highly focused and functional is better.

## Actions
1. A "main" action that:
   - Takes no input parameters
   - Returns a string result
   - Emits progress events with a number value
   - Demonstrates basic functionality by showing a cowsay message and counting

2. A "cowsay" action that:
   - Takes a text string as input
   - Returns the cowsay result as a string
   - No events emitted

3. A "count" action that:
   - Takes a "to" number parameter
   - No return value
   - Emits progress events with the current count

## Backend actions

The backend should expose the following actions:
<actions>${JSON.stringify(actions, null, 2)}</actions>

Pow is a global object that contains the PowBlocs runtime functionality, here are the methods:
- Pow.returnValue(result: Record<string, any>): returns the result to the PowBlocs runtime. Use it for any output that doesn't need streaming, the final result.
- Pow.registerAction(actionName: string, action: (data: Record<string, any>) => void): registers an action that can be called by the PowBlocs runtime. The runtime will call the actions from a UI with list of actions. These are the entry points for the user to interact with the block.
- Pow.dirPath(name): returns the path to the specified user directory. User directory names are: audio, cache, config, data, data_local, desktop, document, download, executable, font, home, picture, preference, public, runtime, template, video, config_local, state.
- Pow.send(eventName: string, data: Record<string, any>): sends an event to the PowBlocs runtime. Use for any output that needs streaming.
- Pow.callAction(actionName: string, input: Record<string, any>): calls an action. This is used to call an action from another action. Chain actions together or reuse them.

Here is an example:

<code>
import * as cowsay from "https://esm.sh/cowsay@1.6.0";

Pow.registerAction("main", async () => {
  let result = cowsay.say({ text: "ðŸ¤  ðŸš€" });

  Pow.returnValue({ result });
});

Pow.registerAction("cowsay", async ({ text }: { text: string }) => {
  let result = cowsay.say({ text });

  Pow.returnValue({ result });
});
</code>


Implement the complete code. DO NOT add placeholder comments. You should implement the full functionality. DO NOT fake or simulate doing anything. IMPLEMENT THE CODE.

BE sure to not let features half baked or variables unused.


Use the <thinking></thinking> tag to think about the implementation before you generate it.

Generate the code inside <code></code> tags.`;

The backend exposes the following actions:
<actions>${JSON.stringify(actions, null, 2)}</actions>

There are global hooks and functions that you can use to listen to events and state changes, and to fire actions:
- Pow.useEvent(eventName, (data) => {
  // do something
})
- const result = Pow.useActionResult(actionName, (data) => {
  // do something
})
- Pow.runAction(actionName, input)

function App() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const [countTo, setCountTo] = useState(10);

  // Get result from cowsay action
  const result = Pow.useActionResult('cowsay');

  // Track progress from count action
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
  Pow.useEvent('progress', (data) => {
    setProgress(data.progress);
  });
